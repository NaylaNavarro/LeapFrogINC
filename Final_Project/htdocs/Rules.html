        <p>LeapFrog Chess works much like any other game of chess except, while all the pieces look normal, their move-sets randomize at the start of every new game.</p>
        <br>
        <p>General Rules</p>
<p>1.	The game ends when a M-King (piece with the King Move-set) is checkmated or a player resigns.</p>
<p>2.	M-King: Moves one square in any direction. The M-King cannot move into check (a position where it would be captured).
        </p>
<p>3.	M-Queen: Moves any number of squares in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
</p>
<p>4.	M-Rook: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
</p>
<p>5.	M-Bishop: Moves any number of squares diagonally.
</p>
<p>6.	M-Knight: Moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction (horizontal or vertical) and then one square perpendicular to that direction. M-Knights can jump over other pieces.
</p>
<p>7.	M-Pawn: Moves forward one square. On its first move, a M-Pawn can move forward two squares. (See Special Rules: [Leapfrog Clause] for exceptions) M-Pawns capture diagonally, one square forward to the left or right. When a M-Pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it is promoted to any other piece (except M-King). (See Special Rules: [Exchange Clause] for specific M-Pawn exchange rules)
</p>
<p>8.	Touch-Rule is always active (if you click on a piece, you must move it).
</p>
<p>9.	Stalemate: If a player has no legal moves and their M-King is not in check, the game is a draw.
</p>
        <br>
<p>Special Rules</p>
<p>1.	Leapfrog Clause: If a M-Pawn is in the back row, on its first move, it may "leapfrog" over the piece in front of it to the next square directly beyond it, provided that square is unoccupied. If that square is also occupied, the M-Pawn cannot move.</p>
<p>2.   Exchange Clause: When a M-Pawn makes it to the other side of the board, the player may convert it into any physical piece of their choosing; however, the M-set of the piece is still randomized. The player will not know what M-Piece they have received until they move it.</p>
