        <p class="note">LeapFrog Chess works much like any other game of chess except, while all the pieces look normal, their move-sets randomize at the start of every new game.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="rule-title">General Rules</p>
        <p class="rules"><span class="bold">**   M- [piece name]</span> refers to the move-set that is attached to each game piece (ex: M- Queen refers to the game piece with the Queen's move-set, not the physical Queen piece).   <span class="bold">**</span></p>
<p class="rules">1. <span class="bold">How to win:</span> The game ends when an M- King is checkmated or a player resigns.</p>
<p class="rules">2. <span class="bold">M- King:</span> Moves one square in any direction. The M- King cannot move into check (a position where it can be captured).
</p>
<p class="rules">3. <span class="bold">M- Queen:</span> Moves any number of squares in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
</p>
<p class="rules">4. <span class="bold">M- Rook:</span> Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
</p>
<p class="rules">5. <span class="bold">M- Bishop:</span> Moves any number of squares diagonally.
</p>
<p class="rules">6. <span class="bold">M- Knight:</span> Moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction (horizontal or vertical) and then one square perpendicular to that direction. M- Knights can jump over other pieces.
</p>
<p class="rules">7. <span class="bold">M- Pawn:</span> Moves forward one square. On its first move, an M- Pawn can move forward two squares (See Special Rules: [Leapfrog Clause] for exceptions). M- Pawns capture diagonally, one square forward to the left or right. When an M- Pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it is promoted to any other piece, except for an M- King (See Special Rules: [Exchange Clause] for specific M- Pawn exchange rules).
</p>
<p class="rules">8.	<span class="bold">Touch Rule</span> is always active (if you click on a piece, you must move it).
</p>
<p class="rules">9. <span class="bold">Stalemate:</span> If a player has no legal moves and their M- King is not in check, the game is a draw.
</p>
        <br>
<p class="rule-title">Special Rules</p>
<p class="rules">1.	 <span class="bold">Leapfrog Clause:</span> If an M- Pawn is in the back row, on its first move, it may "leapfrog" over the piece in front of it to the next square directly beyond it, provided that square is unoccupied. If that square is also occupied, the M- Pawn cannot move.</p>
<p class="rules">2.  <span class="bold">Exchange Clause:</span> When an M- Pawn makes it to the other side of the board, the player may convert it into any physical piece of their choosing; however, the move-set of the piece is still randomized. The player will not know what M- Piece they have received until they move it.</p>
