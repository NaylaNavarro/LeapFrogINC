<p class="rules">1. <b>How to win:</b> The game ends when a King is checkmated or a player resigns.</p>
<p class="rules">2. <b>King:</b> Moves one square in any direction. The King cannot move into check (a position where it can be captured).
</p>
<p class="rules">3. <b>Queen:</b> Moves any number of squares in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
</p>

</p>
<p class="rules">7. <b>Pawn:</b> Moves forward one square. On its first move, a Pawn can move forward two squares. Pawns capture diagonally, one square forward to the left or right. When a Pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece of the player's choice, except a King.
</p>

</p>
<p class="rules">9. <b>Stalemate:</b> If a player has no legal moves and their King is not in check, the game is a draw.
